# StatSaber

### What is it?
StatSaber is a statistical Discord bot for the Beat Saber ranking system [BeatLeader](https://www.beatleader.xyz/).

### What are its uses?
StatSaber has various commands that allow you to do things such as displaying your profile card, showing your top and recent scores, searching for maps, and displaying map info, with more to come!

### How can I host this myself?
There are various ways you can host this yourself. You could run it on your own computer using something like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You could also run it on an online IDE (like me) with something like [Replit](https://replit.com/), or you could run it using an actual server, which I wouldn't know anything about, but it shouldn't be that hard. :)

### Where can I find help?
You can find help in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VqHBGf3g), or you could DM me on Discord at @dizzyjune.
